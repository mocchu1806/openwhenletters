                  but I had no idea what to do for you and since your boring IT girlfriend has got no creativity <br>
                  so here we go! Even if it's just a boring website it took me some great efforts to put on, asshole. <br>
                  Boy, you've got my heart there right next to yours and I know it is super safe there. I just wanted <br>
                  to make a small little thing so that even if I am not there with you, you could always think of me <br>
                  through these letters.<br>
                  Keep on reading them, no cheating, no peeking, you'll realize how I have portrayed my words for you.<br> <br>

                I love you because you're the only person in the world who'd matter to me.<br>
                I love you because you'd always understand me and support me. <br>
                I love you because you care about me and you would never leave me during my time of need. <br>
                I love you because you make me laugh when I'm sad or happy and would never leave me crying. <br>
                I love you because you always motivate me and make me strong <br>
                to face all my problems instead of asking me to avoid em. <br>
                I love you because you forgive me whenever I do stupid things. <br>
                I love you because you're the sweetest and loving guy in the universe and any girl would <br>
                die just to have you. <br>
                I love you because you treat me like the only girl in the world in fact the only person, <br>
                you treat me like your queen and there's no one else you could love except me. <br>
                I love you because you're never afraid to show all your feeling and your love to me. <br>
                I love you because there's no one else in this world like you, and you're the only human being I need in my life.<br>
                I've written 10 reasons why I love you. If I were to keep on going, my list would just go endless. I know no one's <br>
                perfect but for me YOU ARE! <br> <br>

                Okay so this is a bit of my googling fact <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                "Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved."<br>
                Also remember, "I may not have the driver's license but I can drive you crazy."<br>
                Enough of this lame shit, I know either you did something something stupid or I must have over reacted<br>
                as usual because I dont know I am sorry though. I love you no matter what happens between us babe and <br>
                never forget that babe. You know how to get me back to mood and I will be getting back to you with my <br>
                apology. So don't stay mad at me now, text me or maybe I already must have done it. Baat karo muse!! <br> <br>

              Babe, <br>
              First of all, I want to congratulate you on having a good enough day to open this one. <br>
              I wonder what you're happy about right now? whatever it is, don't forget that feeling,<br>
              because when you have a bad day, you really miss this feeling as it's a great feeling isn't it? <br>
              It really makes me wonder who OR what made your day amazing, <br>
              maybe Dutt gave you some extra marks for you being the smartest or dad and you had the best time today<br>
              and if it wasn't a person, then I wonder what it was.Maybe a bunch of good things just happened in a sequence <br>
              and that's what made your day good. Whatever it is, I'm happy that you're happy. Also tell me about it tonight<br>
              and keep that feeling as long as possible and don't let an asshole get in the way of your good day. <br>
              Make this good day last, you deserve it. I just love when your happy because it makes me happy too.<br>
              You get this biggest smile on your face and you have the energy to run a mile. Run that mile, and maybe an extra.<br><br>
              Your Love,<br>

              You might be thinking about your future, or us or why this girl is not giving me time or you <br>
              fought with your family cause they misunderstood you. <br>
              Don't worry. I'm always here for you even when I'm not phisically there. <br>
              I'm always there in your hard. When you feel lost just remember me, and forget about the cruel world. <br>
              Life is awful. We live in a world were being cruel is like a normal thing that happens everyday and acting good <br>
              is like a miracle. Just remember that it always been like that and we can't do anything to stop it <br>
              by accepting it and just follow the flow of life. But this world becomes a better place because of <br>
              the people we love. They become our purpose. And I believe that everyone of us has a reason on <br>
              this planet and change the world through love and make this place a better place if that even make sense lol.<br><br>

                It's just a dream. Don't take it seriously. Just try not to think about it and go back to sleep.<br>
                Just think about something fun. Think of use being together and you might dream about that and for sure<br>
                you will feel better.. I love you so much. I'll take the bad dream with a kiss :* <br><br>
                Your Love,<br>

                I know not being together sucks. But as long as our love is through with could get <br>
                through whatever even if we're thousand miles away to each other. Always remember that our heart <br>
                is so close to each other.I love you okay! <br>
                I love you because you're the only person who could understand me and never left me <br>
                through my ups and down.I love you because you love me. I love you because I don't know what would I do <br>
                without you. I love you so much and I couldn't find anyone else like you, so just stay with me and <br>
                bare with me. I love you baby. <br><br>
                Your Love,<br>

                Babe, <br>
                Hai silly. I'm sorry you can't sleep! This is going to be a long one. You always stay up way <br>
                too late. Try to text me and see if I'm still awake because if I am.I'll tell you a few things to do <br>
                (I googled)that have been proven effectual:<br>
               -The thing I do is play scenarios and make up stories in my head. Usually they are about you or us,<br>
                something that I really wish would happen or I think about what we will do.<br>
                It's very comforting for me and I hope it is for you too.<br>
               -Try listening to soft music and cuddling your pillow and hopefully you'll be sound asleep soon. <br>
               -Think of sleepy thoughts and feelings; create a quiet environment around you. <br>
               -If you've been just lying in bed and it seems completely impossible to fall asleep, then you could <br>
               possibly get up and take a nice slow walk around your house. Maybe this can get you fully tired and <br>
               unwind you and finally let you sleep.<br>
               -Make some hot tea or something to sooth you.<br>
               -Try to get rid of your phone because the bright electronic light of the screen usually bothers us and affects <br>
                the way we sleep.<br>
                I really wish this letter helps you sleep soundly. Try these things and see if they will help you with the insomnia.<br>
                Open and enjoy the sweet little message. Goodnight sweetie.<br><br>
                Your Love,<br>
